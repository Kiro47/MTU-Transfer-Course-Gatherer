## Archival Notice

Due to a number of constraints regarding time and scheduling between the people working on this project (mostly on the lack of my personal time) this project has been abandoned for the time being.  However, one of the old members of this project [@codetheweb](https://github.com/codetheweb) decided to continue on his own and started over again knowing what we know now.

They have actively deployed this website to https://michigantechcourses.com/ and have done a great job with it.  The code for the project is now under an the [Michigan-Tech-Courses Organization](https://github.com/Michigan-Tech-Courses).  You should carry on and support them at the new project if you're able to.

The process to find out what classes are tranferable into MTU is an absolute
pain, so this tool was born.
